In [example_run/](example_run/), you can find a [GIF](example_run/run.gif) of an example LLM-AAI episode, along with a detailed [trace](example_run/run.md) of the observation-command pairs for that episode.

In [experiment_1/](experiment_1/), you can find the ReAct-based [background prompt](experiment_1/prompt.md) provided to the LLMs.

In [experiment_2/](experiment_2/), you can find a [GIF](experiment_2/prompt.gif) of the supervised learning tutorial-example provided to the LLMs, along with a detailed [trace](experiment_2/prompt.md) of the observation-command pairs for that example episode.

In [exploratory_experiments/](exploratory_experiments/), you can find the [results](exploratory_experiments/results.md) of the frame-by-frame and finetuning experiments. In the [frame-by-frame subfolder](exploratory_experiments/frame_by_frame/), you can find the [prompt](exploratory_experiments/frame_by_frame/prompt.md), a description of the [method](exploratory_experiments/frame_by_frame/method.md) used for the frame-by-frame experiment, as well as an example interaction [GIF](exploratory_experiments/frame_by_frame/example_run_arena_01_06_02.gif) (this is the GIF shown above in this README). In the [finetuning subfolder](exploratory_experiments/finetuning/), you can find a description of the [method](exploratory_experiments/finetuning/method.md) used for the finetuning experiment.

In the [reproducibility statement](reproducibility_statement.md), you will find the exact LLM API checkpoints and version of Animal-AI used, as well as some notes about a recurring API error we ran into.

Finally, the [aai_competition_levels.md](aai_competition_levels.md) file provides a detailed description of the levels in the Animal-AI testbed.
