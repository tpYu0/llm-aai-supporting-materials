All the results presented in this paper can be reproduced, provided that the closed-source LLM checkpoints that were tested are not altered. The checkpoints used were:
- Claude 3.5 Sonnet:claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620
- GPT-4o:gpt-4o-2024-05-13
- Gemini 1.5 Pro:gemini-1.5-pro-001
- GPT-o4 mini:2025-04-16

During our experiments we encountered issues with the API for Gemini 1.5 Pro, these issues were the only occasions in which we had to discard and rerun trials, as it stopped us from collecting complete data for trials. The API issue we encountered is documented at https://github.com/google-gemini/generative-ai-python/issues/559.

We produced all of our results using Animal-AI version 3.1.3.
