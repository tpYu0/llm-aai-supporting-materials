The Animal-AI Testbed consists of 10 levels of 30 tests with 3 variants each (n=900 tasks). Each level tests a different aspect of physical common sense reasoning.


| Level  | Description |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| L1 - Food Retrieval  | Navigation towards rewarding objects in a large arena.  |
| L2 - Preferences  | Choice between objects with different reward values, indicated by their size and colour.  |
| L3 - Static Obstacles | Objects partially occluded behind static obstacles around which agents must navigate. |
| L4 - Avoidance | Navigation around punishing objects to obtain rewarding objects. |
| L5 - Spatial Reasoning and Support | Based on the absence of rewarding objects in one part of the arena, agents must infer their presence elsewhere, even when (partially) occluded. Rewarding objects may also be out of reach on a ledge or a pillar, requiring the agent to push a movable block to knock them down. |
| L6 - Generalisation | Tasks from the first five levels are adapted so that the surroundings are colours. |
| L7 - Internal Modelling | Tasks from the first five levels with alternating periods in which visual information is withheld, as though the lights have gone out. The agent must continue to model their environment during these periods. |
| L8 - Object Permanence and Working Memory | Rewards are hidden behind obstacles for the agent to find. |
| L9 - Numerosity and Advanced Preferences | Discrimination between different numbers of rewarding objects, testing the ability to visually discriminate and count objects in a scene. |
| L10 - Causal Reasoning | Rewarding objects are only obtainable using a tool with certain physical properties and affordances. |
